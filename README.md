This is just a fun little arduino side project

The components used are:
-Servo motor
-Ultrasonic Sensor Module
-Analog Joystick Moduel
-Active Buzzer

The joystick allows you to control the movement of the servo motor, using the x-axis on the joystick.
The sensor checks if something is within 10cm of it, if true, the active buzzer whille go off and the servo motor will move.
